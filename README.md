## Tips

+ Understand the difference between level design and environmental design. In a lot of cases it's important to learn both so you can differentiate the two. Level design is worried about context of gameplay, the purpose of each room, designing from a mechanic perspective, and the overall flow between each room. Environment Design is visualization of centerpieces, how the level "looks", theming, and using props/textures/colors to differentiate rooms.

## Not Categorized

+ [Bubble Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-r6RFK8I7k) - Very handy way to get an flow, goals, pacing, scope, and main ideas communicated to your team without worrying about geo architecture. It also can help quickly communicate initial design language, like knowing where certain mechanics will be employed per room.
+ [Creating Prototype Kits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50wIYx5SPI) - Used to build up a library of building block, modular "primitives" to rapidly prototype room ideas.

## Tools

+ [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) - A modern 2D level editor.
+ [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) - PureRef is a wonderful tool to collect your visual ideas for each sequence of the map. Even if you are not a dedicated environment artist, you may find this useful. I usually gather several images to represent some visual ideas/architecture to propose for the block-in.
+ [Probuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder) - A free Unity extension that is great for rapidly building initial 3D level geo.

## Combat Encounters

+ [The Door Problem](https://andrewyoderdesign.blog/2019/08/04/the-door-problem-of-combat-design/) - A blog post teaching how to build more engaging combat encounter rooms (specifically in first person shooters).
